# 100 Days of Code
---------------------
## Disclaimer:

*** This repo is dedicated to Python programming practice, and also to practice editing .md files. Some of the exercises are taken from [darprinx](https://github.com/darkprinx/100-plus-Python-programming-exercises-extended) collection of Python exercises. Also I will include some solutions to problems from Codewars.
